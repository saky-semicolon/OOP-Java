## Prequisites

- Here in this repository I won't talk about the basics of programming. I assume that you have a basic understanding of programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, etc. If you are new to programming, I recommend you to go through the following instruction before starting with this repository.

You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/saky-semicolon/Introduction-to-Programming"> <strong>Introduction to Programming </strong></a> repository for a quick overview of programming concepts.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions). It's a way of structuring software by modeling real-world entities as objects that interact with each other.

OOP languages, such as Java, C++, Python, and others, enable developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by organizing it into objects that interact with each other. It provides a way to manage complexity in software development by breaking down problems into manageable entities (objects) that model real-world or abstract concepts.
